# EXPERIMENT NO. 1
## Title: Android and iOS Development Environment
## Android Development Environment
### 1. Programming Languages
- **Java**: The traditional language used for Android development.
- **Kotlin**: A modern language recommended by Google for Android apps. It is concise and fully interoperable with Java.
### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development. It provides code editing, UI design, debugging, and device emulation.
### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **Android SDK**: A set of tools and libraries required to develop Android applications. It includes:
  - Android Emulator
  - Platform tools
  - Build tools
### 4. Build System
- **Gradle**: The build system used in Android Studio. It manages dependencies, builds APK files, and handles different versions of an app.
### 5. Emulator
- **Android Emulator**: A virtual device that lets developers test their apps without a physical phone.
### 6. User Interface Design
- **XML Layouts**: Used to define the structure of UI components.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A newer toolkit to design UI using Kotlin code in a declarative style.
### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Android Jetpack**: A collection of libraries that help in building robust Android apps. Includes:
  - LiveData
  - ViewModel
  - Room (database)
  - Navigation
  - WorkManager
### 8. Testing
- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing the business logic.
- **Espresso**: Used for UI testing.
- **Robolectric**: Allows running unit tests on JVM without using an emulator.
## iOS Development Environment
### 1. Programming Languages
- **Objective-C**: A legacy programming language for iOS apps.
- **Swift**: A modern and safe programming language developed by Apple.

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Xcode**: The official IDE for iOS development. It includes a code editor, simulator, and Interface Builder.

### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **iOS SDK**: Includes essential libraries like:
  - UIKit (UI elements)
  - Foundation (data handling)
  - Core Data (database)

### 4. Build System
- **Xcode Build System**: Manages building, linking, and packaging of iOS apps.

### 5. Simulator
- **iOS Simulator**: Allows developers to test iOS apps on virtual iPhones, iPads, etc.

### 6. User Interface Design
- **Storyboard and XIB**: Visual tools in Xcode for designing user interfaces.
- **SwiftUI**: A modern framework for designing UI using Swift code.

### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Cocoa Touch**: A base framework that includes UIKit, Foundation, and other core libraries.
- **Combine**: A framework to handle asynchronous tasks and event streams.

### 8. Testing
- **XCTest**: Used for both unit testing and UI testing in Xcode.
- **Quick/Nimble**: Popular third-party tools for writing readable tests.
